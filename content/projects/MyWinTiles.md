This is my productivity(spelling) tools.

The tiling(spelling) window manager for Windows that built on top of explorer shell.

Focus heavily on keyboard usage (vim-like) to prevent mouse usage which
usually need in the typical stacking window manager (use mouse to minimize, maximize, focus and close window) .

Improve the productivity(spelling) of any user that heavily use keyboard on their daily basis.
